    <h1>My history</h1>
      <h2> I started doing rhythmic gymnastics in 2014 and am still doing it. I don’t remember where I trained before 2016, but in February 2016 I moved to Natalia Kuznetsova’s school, where I still train.
        In addition to gymnastics, I study at a music school. I went there in 2016, when I was in 1st grade.

      <h2> But at the beginning of 2022, I learned about the NSPM school. Since I was in 6th grade, I decided to go there. Therefore, I had to leave music school and gymnastics to prepare for NSPM. I started going to the Clevers center for preparation. I couldn’t score enough points for a grant, but enough for a paid department, so I went to the 7th grade in a paid department and after 1 quarter switched to a grant.
